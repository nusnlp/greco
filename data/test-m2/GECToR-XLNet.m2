S A very important characteristic of the UK constitution , and one which is central to the question of sovereignty , is that it is the Westminster Parliament that is the supreme legal authority in the UK .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S According to the orthodox school which subscribes to the views of Albert Venn Dicey , the Westminster Parliament is omnicompetent and can pass laws on any subject it likes to regulate the activities of any person , anywhere , even those of aliens outside British territory .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In theory , then , the Westminster Parliament could pass a law banning smoking on the streets of Paris .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If our Parliament did so , British courts would be obliged to accept Parliament 's decision and pass judgement accordingly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Of course , in practise , as the Radical school ( who believe that the Westminster Parliament is not legislatively supreme ) point out , in this hypothetical situation , the Parisiens would take no notice whatever of the UK Parliament 's legislation ; and Parliament would in effect be fettered .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Dicey said that as each Parliament is omnipotent , and therefore has the power to make or unmake any law , no Parliament could bind its successors as to the content or manner and form of subsequent legislation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The Radical like to point out that since the passing of the European Communities Act in 1972 , the Westminster Parliament has ceded its sovereignty and supremacy to Europe .
A 1 2|||R:NOUN:NUM|||Radicals|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The orthodox school retaliate by pointing out that since a Westminster Parliament passed the 1972 Act thereby putting the UK into the European Communities , a future Parliament could just as easily repeal this Act , and take us out of Europe again .
A 9 10|||R:DET|||the|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In this case , Britain would have retained her sovereignty and Parliamentary supremacy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Of course , this whole question is still a subject of fierce debate .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S British courts have avoided a head - on clash by finding ambiguity in a domestic statute and resolving that ambiguity so as to give effect to our Community obligations , or by finding that a statute passed prior to the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed by implication by that Act and does not represent the latest intention of the Westminster Parliament or by arguing that subsequent legislation was inadvertant and that the Westminster Parliament could not have intended to come into conflict with community law .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In a recent development , the European Court of Justice rule in the case of R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame and others ( 1990 ) that courts in Britain must suspend an Act of the Westminster Parliament where the rights of the citizens guaranteed by European Community law may be at risk .

S Nowadays , more and more parents are starting to teach their children at home instead of sending them to school .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This may not be a bad idea at all , but it also has some disadvantages that I would like to discuss .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , we should take into account the fact that parents are n't usually specialized in all fields of study : even if they have a degree in History , they may not know how to help their children with a mathematics problem .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Besides , staying at home rather than going to school reduces the opportunities of meeting new people and making friends .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is n't a good thing for the children because that way they are n't socializing , and when it comes the moment of having an interview to get a job , they wo n't really know how to behave .
A 7 8|||U:DET||||||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , having the chance to learn at home helps some students that , due to their complicated situation -like an illness- , can not go to school like the other children .
A 32 33|||U:DET||||||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To sum up , I consider that children should study at school if they can afford it , because in the majority of cases , parents haven't the same knowledge as teachers .

S Boxing is one of the most popular sports of this era , it is almost one of the most deadly .

S Even though there is the protective liquid the brain still gets bounced about against the skull , damaging it more and more every time .

S Getting away from the long term effects to the short term effects , yes brain cells are still being killed but when a boxer receives a very strong punch direct to the face not only would it damage his nose , eyes , teeth and general facial features but it could also cause him to enter a coma , haemorage or die .
